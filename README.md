-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Our client, Artemis Financial sought out for assistance in addressing software security vulnerabilities and enhancing their application's overall security. They recognized the importance of implementing measures to protect user data, ensure the integrity of their systems, and establish trust with their customers.

-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
During the assessment of the client's software security vulnerabilities I conducted a thorough examination and successfully identified the areas of concern. This was done meticulously to ensure that no vulnerabilities were overlooked. We then took appropriate actions to address and fix these vulnerabilities, patching any weaknesses that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. Coding securely is of upmost importance as it helps prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromises. By prioritizing software security, companies can safeguard sensitive information, maintain customer trust, and mitigate the financial and reputational risks associated with security incidents. 

-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The assessment presented many challenges, if not all.  Identifying all possible vulnerabilities and ensuring comprehensive coverage can be time-consuming and complex. However, it was crucial to thoroughly evaluate the application to identify any potential weaknesses that could be exploited. The assessment provided valuable insights into the security posture of the application, guiding the implementation of appropriate mitigation techniques.

-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
To increase layers of security measures like implementing self-signed certificates for HTTPS, validating the hashing function, and patching vulnerabilities found during the dependency check. In the future, additional tools and techniques, such as penetration testing, security audits, and code review, could be utilized to assess vulnerabilities and determine suitable mitigation strategies.

-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the functionality and security of the code and software application many testings were done. After refactoring the code, further testing was conducted to identify any newly introduced vulnerabilities, ensuring that the security enhancements did not compromise the overall integrity of the system.

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
In this assignment, we utilized various resources, tools, and coding practices to address software security. These may include dependency check tools, checksum verification, secure coding guidelines, and industry best practices. Leveraging these resources and practices in future assignments or tasks can greatly assist in maintaining and enhancing software security.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
For future employers, this assignment serves as an example of successfully addressing software security vulnerabilities and implementing security measures. It showcases skills in vulnerability assessment, secure coding, and implementing security enhancements. It demonstrates the ability to identify and mitigate potential risks, ensuring the protection of sensitive data and the overall security of an application.
